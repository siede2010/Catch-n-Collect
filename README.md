# Catch-n-Collect
HTL project <br>
[MC : Otto the Otter] <br>
### Story :
It was a normal day like everyday, the flower's were blooming, the sun was shining and most importantly Otto was sitting <br>
at the peer of his local lake, enjoying the fresh breeze when he noticed something off. <br>
looking at the water he was surprised to find a empty tin can. <br>
He quickly picked it up and threw it with accuracy into the metal trash bin before returning to his very important activity of sitting down and enjoying the view. <br>
Until he saw another piece of trash floating around. <br>
Annoyed at all that trash in his local Lake, he picks up his trusty fishing rod and starts to collect the trash... <br>
[- Level 1 Here] <br>
Satisfied of having fished out all the trash out of his local lake, he threw all the trash, sorted into its respective trash bin. <br>
He quickly cleaned up his equipment and headed back home while the sun was lowering beond the horizon. <br>
He shut off his lights as he arrived and launched himself directly into his bed. <br>
Tomorrow, he was Shocked as mail was waiting for him. <br>
he open'd it to read its content : <br>

That night. Otto couldnt sleep, while the Letter intrigued him, he doubted if he realy could make a difference. <br>
The idea of traveling to clean up other areas filled him with a sense of purpose, but it was also a bit intimidating. <br>
With these thoughts time passed throughout the night till the early morning. <br>
Feeling tired he brewed himself Diluted Orange Juice and chugged it down in one gulp. <br>
the Mild sweetness of the Orange instantly woke him up and he grabbed his gear before deciding to accept the offer and travel to bever river. <br>

Happy with today's accomplishments, Otto returned home and cooked himself some seaweed, <br>
enjoying the simple and nutritious meal as he reflected on the day's events. <br>
The worlds "Everyone loves you" realy stuck in his head as he ate the Seaweed. <br>
Feeling a sense of happyness he quickly turned off the lights and headed to bed. <br>
