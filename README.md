# Catch-n-Collect
HTL project <br>
[MC : Otto the Otter] <br>
### Story :
It was a normal day like everyday, the flower's were blooming, the sun was shining and most importantly Otto was sitting <br>
at the peer of his local lake, enjoying the fresh breeze when he noticed something off. <br>
looking at the water he was surprised to find a empty tin can. <br>
He quickly picked it up and threw it with accuracy into the metal trash bin before returning to his very important activity of sitting down and enjoying the view. <br>
Until he saw another piece of trash floating around. <br>
Annoyed at all that trash in his local Lake, he picks up his trusty fishing rod and starts to collect the trash... <br>
[- Level 1 Here] <br>
Satisfied of having fished out all the trash out of his local lake, he threw all the trash, sorted into its respective trash bin. <br>
He quickly cleaned up his equipment and headed back home while the sun was lowering beond the horizon. <br>
He shut off his lights as he arrived and launched himself directly into his bed. <br>
Tomorrow, he was Shocked as mail was waiting for him. <br>
he open'd it to read its content : <br>

## -- Level 2 -- <br>

That night. Otto couldnt sleep, while the Letter intrigued him, he doubted if he realy could make a difference. <br>
The idea of traveling to clean up other areas filled him with a sense of purpose, but it was also a bit intimidating. <br>
With these thoughts time passed throughout the night till the early morning. <br>
Feeling tired he brewed himself Diluted Orange Juice and chugged it down in one gulp. <br>
the Mild sweetness of the Orange instantly woke him up and he grabbed his gear before deciding to accept the offer and travel to bever river. <br>

C.e.o Bill (Bever) : "There you are! almost worried you wouldnt make it" <br>
Otto : (enthusiastic Nodding) <br>
C.e.o Bill : "Well. you can go ahead Champ, gear is prepeared at the docs" <br>
Otto : (Happy walking) <br>
[- Level 2 here] <br>
Having finished Fishing he took the message bottle from the water and read it. <br>
<b>
Hey Otto, <br>
Great job doing the job, we've got it all recorded and you did amazing. <br>
Everyone loves you! <br>
Keep it up and you might be a Nature superstar. <br>
Next spot would be the east sea coast. <br>
good luck! <br>

Happy with today's accomplishments, Otto returned home and cooked himself some seaweed, <br>
enjoying the simple and nutritious meal as he reflected on the day's events. <br>
The worlds "Everyone loves you" realy stuck in his head as he ate the Seaweed. <br>
Feeling a sense of happyness he quickly turned off the lights and headed to bed. <br>

## -- Level 3 -- <br>
"Another fresh start" Otto mentions as he gets dressed up to go to the east sea coast today. <br>
He took off to travel through the main city. <br>
The island was split up in 2 parts, the main city and the local city with the main city using less <br>
eco friendly methods to keep running. <br>
The Local city on the other hand, where Otto lives, was a lot bigger and had more eco friendly methods of modernisation. <br>
He looked around, looking at all that concrete with a frown. <br>
Reaching the east coast Otto was shocked by so much litter, even on the sand. <br>
He quickly gather'd the sand waste with a net provided by Bill before he started to fish for the rest. <br>
[- Level 3 here] <br>
it already has gotten late, Otto turned on a small flashlight and read the message in the bottle. <br>
<b>

Reminder : Everyone will be watching just as they did today. <br>

## -- Level 4 -- <br>
That night. Otto couldnt sleep, he was contemplating if he could clean the ocean. <br>
It was a big task. Too big for him to handle and if he failed... <br>
He couldnt bear to imagine the millions of people who would be disapointed. <br>
Looking back at his achivements over the past few day's made Otto smile and gave him some well needed Courage. <br>
YES! He could do it! He will do it! There is nothing that will ever stop Otto! <br>
... <br>
In the morning he rushed down and after gulping down his breakfeast in one go departed for the Boat waiting for him. <br>
He was going to make everyone proud. <br>
[- Level 4 here] <br>
Its just too much! <br>
No matter how Otto looked at it, the amount of trash in the Ocean was never ending. <br>
He felt hopeless as he looked towards the horizon where he could see even more trash. <br>
and to add to that the weather was getting rough, they couldnt stay out there. <br>
Otto felt utterly defeated, he couldnt do it... <br>
he listened to the online radio while he sat down, the camera's of the hot air balloon have already shut off... <br>
Radio : "And for the newest piece of info an Otter called Otto ha..." <br>
Otto didnt listen to the radio any longer and simply sat there, tears dripping down his face as it began to rain. <br>
... <br>
All of a sudden a plastic bottle with a message fell onto his head, above, Bill was waving to him with a smile. <br>
Otto was confused, why was he smiling? he looked at the bottle and open'd the message inside it. <br>
<b>
Have you been listening to the radio Otto? <br>
A ton of people have gather'd and started to fish out the trash out of the Ocean just as you did today. <br>
You did a great job. <br>
You truly are an Idol for all to look up too. <br>
With kind regards, <br>
- Your Friend, Bill aka. Ceo of Sun dip n Moon <br>

(it should end with a last pannel of Otto smiling and the sun shining through a hole in the clouds) <br>
